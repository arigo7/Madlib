Dear #{your_name},

I am writing you this message in PLanguage because my Spanish 
is #{Adjective1} so I wanted to show off a little. I cannot tell you how it happened 
but I have  #{Adverb1} decided to get enough courage and  #{Verb1} you so you would know… So here is my  confession:

 I think it’s about #{TimeAndPlace} I do so and thank you for #{(Verb1.concat)ing} this 
    message.  I haven’t stopped thinking about the #{Time.convert to number} time we met and about that first night 
    we spent  #{Verb2} until #{Number1} am in the morning! ___exclamation—. You were wearing 
    that ___favorite clothing_  you _ adverb_ wear on Sundays when we hang out and you were waiting 
    for the bus. That day I would have never imagined that you would become my __adjective___ friend. 
        You are _____adj— at programming and I am great at _____ so I think we are just going to be ______ forever. 
        I __HOpe__ you think so too and I would _verb_ to know if you feel the same. Are you in?

Your response: Yes or no?
